    <h1> The Semester Begins </h1>

    <p>I was still as nervous and excited as ever. My first time attending was actually the second day of class since I was on my way to UH from 
      California. Luckily everyone was friendly and it was easy to talk to people. The activities both inside and outside of class were fun. I would
      always look forward to anything related to the course. And in the end we would all have a blast participating in research abroad.

      One of my fondest memories is actually regarding the tide charts we were supposed to learn about and complete an assignment on. As much as I 
      tried to follow along, I was clueless. But it was also the moment in which the whole experience felt "real". With a little more studying I 
      could understand and answer the questions, and this feeling would probably pop up again during the summer. It reminded me of how much there 
      to both do and learn and it just made me happy to be a part of it.
